# The summary of the steps in the FCI function:

**Create a new Graph:** A new Graph object is created with the number of columns in the dataset as the number of nodes. The graph is then printed.

**Create a Fully Connected Graph:** The createFullyConnectedGraph function is called to create a fully connected graph from the dataset. The graph is then printed again.

**Apply PC Algorithm:** The applyPCAlgorithm function is called to apply the PC algorithm to the graph. This step prunes edges based on conditional independence tests.

**Orient V-Structures:** The orientVStructures function is called to orient V-structures in the graph. A V-structure in a graph is a structure where two nodes have a common child but are not connected.

**Identify Possible D-Sep:** The identifyPossibleDSep function is called to identify the set of possible d-separations in the graph.

**Apply FCI Rules:** The applyFCIRules function is called to apply the FCI orientation rules to the graph. These rules are designed to handle latent and selection variables.

**Final Orientation:** The finalOrientation function is called to apply the final orientation rules to the graph. This is the last step of the FCI algorithm, where as many of the remaining edges as possible are oriented.

**Return the Graph:** The resulting graph is returned as a unique_ptr.

Please note that the actual implementation of these steps will depend on the details of your Graph and Dataset classes, as well as the specific statistical tests you're using for conditional independence.
